This project is a Security Demonstration with Python which involves the use of a SHA 1 password cracker which checks online lists for the passwords and adds it to the list if not there. The addition is done by taking the input from a  keylogger and filtering it for valid passwords. Finally, the list of passwords is encoded into an image and the image is hooked to a deadman's switch which encrypts the file and uses a keyphrase to delete or decrypt the image file.

## Instructions

 1. Run the following command in Command Prompt
	> pip install -r requirements.txt
 2. Download the repository and extract into a single folder
 3. Run the passwordgenerator.py file
 4. After the last dialog, enter any keyphrase in the terminal along with the filename and the encryption password
